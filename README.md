| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 12               | 2-4               |  1 - 5 minutes       | 6 & Up           |

## Objective
Get the most Blinks on your team in this contagious form of table [Curling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling)!

## Setup
Make a single Blink the _Flopper_. This Blink will flip and flop between team colors. The moment a _Flicker_ attaches, it takes on the team of the _Flopper_. The _Flopper_ remains the flopper for the entire game, players split up their _Flickers_ evenly (i.e. 12 Blinks, 2 Player game, 5 _Flickers_ per player. 3 Player game, 3 _Flickers_ per player.)

## Gameplay
Take turns flicking<sup>1</sup> your Blinks towards the _Flopper_. Time your flicking to land the Blink while the _Flopper_ is showing your team color. Knock stray _Flickers_ into the _Flopper_ and get them all to wear your team colors.



<sup>1</sup>Or sliding... but come on, the game isn't called slideFlop
